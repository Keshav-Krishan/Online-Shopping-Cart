# Online-Shopping-Cart
The “Online Shopping Cart” project is a console-based Python application that replicates the essential functionalities of a real-world e-commerce system. It enables users to browse a catalog of digital and physical products, manage items in their cart, calculate totals with tax, and simulate a purchase checkout.
